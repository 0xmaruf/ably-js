# Ably JavaScript Client Library SDK API Reference for Promises

You are currently viewing the promise-based variant of the Ably JavaScript Client Library SDK. View the callback-based variant [here](../default/index.html).

Passing callbacks to methods when using the promise-based variant of the API is still possible, however, if a method does not receive a callback then it will instead return a promise.

To get started with the Ably JavaScript Client Library SDK, follow the [Quickstart Guide](https://ably.com/docs/quick-start-guide) or view the introductions to the [realtime](https://ably.com/docs/realtime/usage) and [REST](https://ably.com/docs/rest/usage) interfaces.
